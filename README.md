# Project Euler
Here are my solutions to Project Euler problems (to learn more https://projecteuler.net/about) because I'm like really really cool and I love nothing other than solving math problems while eating copious amounts of Indian food (no, I don't need to talk about it).

My solution requirements do not necessarily involve finding the most efficient method but revolve around writing clean, coherent, and effective answers.  As this repo is in active development, I'd love to hear any feedback.

Thanks for looking!

Directory Structure (fairly straightforward:

* `problems`: where the Python executable solution files live
* `static`: some Project Euler files are based around utilizing a text file, which live here
* `utils`: many Project Euler problems are similar and to facilitate the reusability of helpful utils...etc, etc, etc
