"""
Using names.txt (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), a 46K text names_file containing over five-thousand first names, begin by sorting it into alphabetical order. Then working out the alphabetical value for each name, multiply this value by its alphabetical position in the list to obtain a name rank_score.

For example, when the list is sorted into alphabetical order, COLIN, which is worth 3 + 15 + 12 + 9 + 14 = 53, is the 938th name in the list. So, COLIN would obtain a rank_score of 938 Ã— 53 = 49714.

What is the total of all the name scores in the names_file?
